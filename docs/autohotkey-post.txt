[color=#800000][size=145][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/color]
[c]StringifyAll[/c] works in conjunction with [url=https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=137065&p=603092#p603092]GetPropsInfo[/url] to allow us to include all of an object's properties in the JSON string, not just the items or own properties.

[c]StringifyAll[/c] exposes many options to programmatically restrict what gets included in the JSON string. It also includes options for adjusting the spacing in the string. To set your options, you can:
[list][*]Copy the template file into your project directory and set the options using the template.
[*]Prepare the [c]ConfigLibrary[/c] class and reference the configuration by name. See the file "templates\ConfigLibrary.ahk". (Added 1.0.3).
[*]Define a class [c]StringifyAllConfig[/c] anywhere in your code.
[*]Pass an object to the [c]Options[/c] parameter.[/list]

The options defined by the [c]Options[/c] parameter supercede options defined by the [c]StringifyAllConfig[/c] class. This is convenient for setting your own defaults based on your personal preferences / project needs using the class object, and then passing an object to the [c]Options[/c] parameter to adjust your defaults on-the-fly.

Callback functions must not call [c]StringifyAll[/c]. [c]StringifyAll[/c] relies on several variables in the function's scope. Concurrent function calls would change their values, causing unexpected behavior for earlier calls.

For usage examples, see "example\example.ahk".

There are some considerations to keep in mind when using [c]StringifyAll[/c] with the intent to later parse it back into a data object.
[list][*]All objects that have one or more of its property values written to the JSON string are represented as an object using curly braces, including array objects and map objects. Since square brackets are the typical indicator that a substring is representing an array object, a parser will interpret the substring as an object with a property that is an array, rather than just an array. (Keep an eye out for my updated JSON parser to pair with [c]StringifyAll[/c]).
[*]A parser would need to handle read-only properties in some way.
[*]Some properties don't necessarily need to be parsed. For example, if I stringified an array object including its native properties, a parser setting the [c]Length[/c] property would be redundant.[/list]

The above considerations are mitigated by keeping separate configurations for separate purposes. For example, keep one configuration to use when intending to later parse the string back into AHK data, and keep another configuration to use when intending to visually inspect the string.

There are some conditions which will cause [c]Stringify[/c] to skip stringifying an object. When this occurs, [c]Stringify[/c] prints a placeholder string instead. The conditions are:
[list][*]The object is a [c]ComObject[/c] or [c]ComValue[/c].
[*]The maximum depth is reached.
[*]Your callback function returned a value directing [c]Stringify[/c] to skip the object.[/list]

When [c]StringifyAll[/c] encounters an object multiple times, it may skip the object and print a string representation of the object path at which the object was first encountered. Using the object path instead of the standard placeholder is so one's code or one's self can identify the correct object that was at that location when [c]Stringify[/c] was processing. This will occur when one or both of the following are true:
[list][*][c]Options.Multiple[/c] is false (the default is false). (added in 1.1.0).
[*]Processing the object will result in infinite recursion.[/list]

[c]StringifyAll[/c] will require more setup to be useful compared to other stringify functions, because we usually don't need information about every property. [c]StringifyAll[/c] is not intended to be a replacement for other stringify functions. Where [c]StringifyAll[/c] shines is in cases where we need a way to programmatically define specifically what properties we want represented in the JSON string and what we want to exclude; at the cost of requiring greater setup time investment, we receive in exchange the potential to fine-tune precisely what will be present in the JSON string.
